# Black Hole Simulation
This simple project simulates the gravitational effects of a black hole on a projectile in a 2D space using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. It can demonstrate the sling-shot effect and other gravitational phenomena.

## Features
- Interactive canvas where users can set the initial velocity of a projectile by clicking and dragging.
- Real-time simulation of gravitational attraction towards a central black hole.
- Options to toggle the visibility of the projectile's trace, velocity vector, and acceleration vector.
